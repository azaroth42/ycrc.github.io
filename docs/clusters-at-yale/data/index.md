# Overview

Each cluster has a small amount of space dedicated to home directories, meant for notes and scripts. There are also project and scratch spaces for larger and more numerous files. Each group is given a free allocation in each of these storage locations (see the [individual cluster pages](/clusters-at-yale/clusters) for details). Contact us at [hpc@yale.edu](mailto:hpc@yale.edu) about purchasing additional cluster storage if your needs exceed your free allocation.

## Other Storage Options

If you or your group finds the HPC storage do not accommodate your needs, please see the [off-cluster research data storage](/data) page or the [ITS Storage Finder](https://storage-finder.yale.edu).
