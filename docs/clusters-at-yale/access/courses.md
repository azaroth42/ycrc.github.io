# Yale Courses on the Clusters

The YCRC Grace and Farnam clusters can be made available for Yale courses with a suitable computational component.

## For Students

If you are taking a course that makes use of one of the YCRC clusters, you will be granted a **temporary** account on that cluster, with the name courseID_netid. This account has special access to a modest storage allocation for your course and, in some cases, dedicated compute resource in a partition named after the course ID.

All accounts associated with the course are temporary and will be deleted two weeks after the last day of exams for that semester.  If you require continued access to the cluster for research purposes after your course ends, you must submit a [new account request](https://research.computing.yale.edu/support/hpc/account-request) for a research account. In the Special Requests field, let us know if you need any transferred from your temporarily course account (before it is deleted at the end of the semester).

Note: Even if you already have a full research account, a secondary temporary course account will be created for you and you will need to use that account for access any course-associated resources. 

## For Instructors

If you are interested in using on the YCRC clusters in your Yale course, contact us at [research.computing@yale.edu](mail-to:research.computing@yale.edu).

Courses on the YCRC clusters are typically granted a standard 1TB project quota for the course, as well as 125GB home directory for each student. See our cluster storage documentation for more details on cluster storage. Let us know if your course requires additional storage. In addition to storage, you may request a small number of nodes (usually 1-2) be dedicated to your students for the semester. These nodes will be placed in a partition named after the course ID.  Please let us know if your course requires any special nodes, such as GPU enabled nodes.

All course allocations on the cluster are **temporary*. We will delete all accounts, data and remove the dedicated partition two weeks after the last day of exams for that semester. If you or a member of your course needs extended access, please let us know as early as possible.
