# Notice of decommissioning of ycga-ba filesystem 

Dear Ruddle Users,

This is an important announcement about one of Ruddle's storage systems. We are planning to retire the old storage system mounted at /ycga-ba. We will continue to run this system as usual until August 16, 2019.  At that time, we will set it to read-only mode, so no further changes can be made. On September 16, 2019 we will shut down /ycga-ba permanently.
 
All YCGA-generated, primary sequence data that were on /ycga-ba have already been archived to tape and removed.  What remains is a collection of old data, mostly written years ago by various users and not archived or backed up by YCGA. We do not plan to bulk copy all of the remaining data. Rather, it is the responsibility of the users; we expect users to seriously determine what they want to keep and then delete unwanted data. If you want to copy/archive important files, please do not transfer large amounts of data to other storage on Ruddle since there is not sufficient space there.
 
If you have problems finding a place for important files located on /ycga-ba, we advise you to contact us so we can provide you with some alternatives regarding where it can be saved.   
 
This shutdown impacts all locations on /ycga-ba, including:
 
```text
/ycga-ba/sequencers[123]/scratch
/ycga-ba/labs
/ycga-ba/lifton
/ycga-ba/state
/ycga-ba/state-bio
/ycga-ba/data1
/ycga-ba/data2
```
 
For help moving important data, please contact robert.bjornson@yale.edu.

If you have any questions about this process, please contact me.
 
Sincerely,

Shrikant Mane

Director, Yale Center for Genome Analysis
