# Notice of decommissioning of ycga-ba filesystem 

Dear Ruddle Users,

We retired the old storage system mounted at /ycga-ba on September 16, 2019.

All YCGA-generated primary sequence data that were on /ycga-ba were already archived to tape and removed.

This shutdown impacted all locations on /ycga-ba, including:

```text
/ycga-ba/sequencers[123]/scratch
/ycga-ba/labs
/ycga-ba/lifton
/ycga-ba/state
/ycga-ba/state-bio
/ycga-ba/data1
/ycga-ba/data2
```
